# ROS simulation bases

## Introduction

In a physical robot project, a lot of code needs to be simulated on a simulation platform.

[ROS](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS) is a mainstream robot operation framework, and your goal is to use this framework to implement a simulation robot based on the ROS platform.

Maybe you can refer to [this](http://www.autolabor.com.cn/book/ROSTutorials).

Please refer to the following "**Procedure**" to complete the relevant work.

## Procedure

### stage1

1. Deploy ROS.
2. Learning Basic operations of ROS.

**Note:** Maybe you can refer to [this](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ci4y1L7ZZ)

### stage2

1. Create a wheeled robot or quadruped robot simulation model.
2. Build simulation environment in ROS.
3. Realize robot autonomous positioning
4. Realize robot self-navigation path planning

### stage3 (optional)

1. [VINS-Mono](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono) is a real-time SLAM framework for Monocular Visual-Inertial Systems,please study this framework and read the relevant papers.
2. Try to build a model of IMU and monocular camera, then apply VINS-Mono to your model.

## Submit

Any details and learning about the deployment process are worth putting in your folder.
