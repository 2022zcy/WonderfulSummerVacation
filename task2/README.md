# Task Outline: Developing an LLM-Based Behavior Generation Engine for a Robot

## Introduction

With the arrival of the SDNU freshman class of 2023, the need for more advanced and intelligent robotic behavior systems has become apparent. Previously, an intelligent dialogue software for robots was developed based on large language models (LLMs). However, with the rapid advancement of embodied intelligence, this software is now seen as less capable. To address this, the goal is to develop an LLM-based behavior generation engine that enables robots to understand and react to human commands more effectively.

The [RoboCodeX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16117) framework provides a foundation for generating multimodal code for robotic behavior synthesis. By building on this framework, we aim to create an intelligent engine that can be deployed on robots like Nao. This engine will enhance the robot's ability to comprehend natural language instructions and execute corresponding behaviors.

## Procedure

### Stage 1: Constructing an Inference Engine

**Objectives:**
1. **Research and Selection:**
   - Understand and compare several mainstream inference engines such as Transformer, VLLM, Tensor-RT, DeepSpeed, and Text Generation Inference.
   - Choose the most suitable inference engine based on criteria like performance, compatibility, and ease of deployment.

2. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the selected inference engine in a suitable environment.
   - Document the deployment process, including system specifications (OS, GPU model, etc.).

3. **Performance Testing:**
   - Measure and document the throughput (number of inferences per second) of the deployed inference engine.
   - Analyze the results and identify any bottlenecks.

**Deliverables:**
- A detailed report on the research and selection process of the inference engine.
- Documentation of the deployment process, including system specifications.
- Performance testing results and analysis.

### Stage 2: Optimizing the Inference Engine

**Objectives:**
1. **Performance Tuning:**
   - Optimize the chosen inference engine to maximize its throughput.
   - Experiment with different settings and configurations to enhance performance.

2. **Benchmarking:**
   - Conduct rigorous benchmarking to compare performance before and after optimization.
   - Document the methods and tools used for optimization.

3. **Analysis and Documentation:**
   - Analyze the results of the optimizations.
   - Provide detailed documentation on the optimization steps, configurations used, and the impact on performance.

**Deliverables:**
- A comprehensive guide on the optimization process, including tools and methods used.
- Comparative benchmarking results (before and after optimization).
- Detailed analysis of the optimization impact.

### Stage 3 (Optional): Building a Fine-Tuned Model for Robotic Behavior

**Objectives:**
1. **Dataset Construction:**
   - Build a dataset specifically designed for generating API code for robotic behavior based on the RoboCodeX framework.
   - Ensure the dataset is well-annotated and suitable for fine-tuning a large model.

2. **Model Fine-Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune a selected pre-trained model using the constructed dataset.
   - Set appropriate hyperparameters and make necessary adjustments to optimize performance for the specific task.

3. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the fine-tuned model's inference precision and performance.
   - (Ensure the fine-tuning process utilizes an NVIDIA GPU, documenting the GPU model and other relevant system specifications.)

**Deliverables:**
- A well-constructed and annotated dataset for robotic behavior code generation.
- Documentation of the fine-tuning process, including dataset preparation, hyperparameter settings, and system specifications.
- Performance evaluation report of the fine-tuned model, highlighting inference precision and any improvements achieved.

### General Notes

- **Environment Setup:** Clearly document the environment setup for each stage, specifying the operating system, GPU model, and any other relevant system details.
- **Tools and Frameworks:** Utilize appropriate tools and frameworks for deployment, optimization, and fine-tuning (e.g., Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, NVIDIA CUDA, etc.).
- **Documentation:** Ensure all processes are thoroughly documented to facilitate reproducibility and understanding.
